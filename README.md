Module description:
This module allows the GM to press a hotkey and select several premade traps and loot caches to instantly create on the map. The trap is instantly surrounded by four “Hints” that can only be seen with the prerequisite passive perception for each.
The exact same hint actors appear around loot caches that can also be created, forcing players to investigate and determine whether they have encountered a blessing or a curse. Ideally hints will be setup in a way vague enough that multiple hints in tandem are required to make this distinction.
Most importantly, the module allows the users to create and edit their own list of traps and caches; setting up multiple hint sets for each that will be chosen randomly decreasing the likelihood of players memorizing hints. All hints and traps can be manually adjusted after creation for further customization.

Dependencies:
This utilizes “Monks Active Tile Triggers” and the “Stealthy” modules.
 
Recommended:
“Item Piles” to set up caches.
I have another support module that enables actors to roll stealth upon creation and enables a minimum viewing distance, beyond which actors will not be able to be seen by players.
