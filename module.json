  "description": "Adds a configurable interface for building traps and caches with stealthy hint tokens. A hot-key opens a menu to select the trap or cache type, location, trigger and difficulty before drawing a tile. When the tile is drawn the module automatically attaches the appropriate macro JSON to the tile and spawns hint tokens around it. The hints are generic enough to be re-used and randomised, and the module can be extended by adding additional trap or cache definitions.",
